NOTE THAT YOU CAN NOT USE THIS AS A PACKAGE VIA LIBRARY() OR REQUIRE() AS OF YET, BUT WE ARE WORKING ON GETTING THERE. 



This set of functions/package is an R interface to the Biodiversity Heritage Library API. 


Get your Biodiversity Heritage Library API here: 
http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/getapikey.aspx


Put your API in your .Rprofile file using e.g., 
options(BHLApiKey = "YOURBHLAPIKEY"), 
and the functions within this package will be able to use your API key without you having to enter it every time you run a search.
