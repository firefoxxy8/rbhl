R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.1 and R development
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win-Builder.

This submission imports functions from default R packages other than 
base used in this package. 

Fixes a non-conformant README link. 

Other fixes to the package as well, and improved package API.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
